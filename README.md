# vtcunit
This is a varnishtest runner which outputs xml in unit 4 format. For automation profit.

Based on http://github.com/brujoand/bauta but modified to only run vtc tests.

Seems to be working well, but could probably be slimmed down a bit.

I'm currently running this in a docker container as a part of our varnish bamboo build.
